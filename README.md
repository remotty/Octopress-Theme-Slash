# Author Box for Octopress

Author Box is a simple Octopress plugin that could display more author information below every single post.

You can configure your authors information if there are multiple authors.

# Feature

* Easily attach author info box with YAML.
* Use Gravatar image url as a author pic.

# Usage

1. Put the plugin file: ```author_box.rb``` into ```plugins``` folder.
* Put ```author.yml``` into your Octopress root path and add your author's information.
* Put ```author.html``` for rendering author box below your posts
* Edit ```_style.scss``` to adjust the style of author box.
* Add or change the ```author: Your Name``` to the metadata on a post. The author name should be exactly matched to one of authors with author.yml.

# TODO

* More easier setting of this plugin(maybe it would be a install script & git submodule as a octopress plugin)
* **More posts of this author** link and its generator
